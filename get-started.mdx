## Provisioning Infrastructure

After creating your dApp, you will be taken to the Infrastructure Hub. Here, you can provision the required infrastructure for your dApp, including Chainlink and other services.

To provision infrastructure, select the desired services and click "Add new Service".

## Configuring Variables

Upon provisioning infrastructure, you will receive configuration variables for your dApp. These variables are essential for connecting and authenticating with the services. Access them in the "Config Vars" section of your dApp settings.
