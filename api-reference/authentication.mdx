```

## API Tokens

API tokens are used to authenticate API requests to 0xCord. To obtain an API token, please follow the authentication process outlined in the [0xCord documentation](/get-started).

## Permissions

Different API endpoints may require specific permissions to access certain resources or perform specific actions. Ensure that your API token has the necessary permissions to make the desired API requests. For more information on permissions and their requirements, refer to the 0xCord API documentation.
